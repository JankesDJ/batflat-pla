# phpLiteAdmin for Batflat
phpLiteAdmin is a web-based SQLite database admin tool written in PHP with support for SQLite3 and SQLite2. Following in the spirit of the flat-file system used by SQLite, phpLiteAdmin consists of a single source fil that is dropped into a directory on a server and then visited in a browser. There is no installation required. The available operations, feature set, interface, and user experience is comparable to that of phpMyAdmin.
